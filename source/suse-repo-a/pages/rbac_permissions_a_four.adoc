== SUSE Observability permissions

There are two types of permission in SUSE Observability. *System permissions* scope user capabilities, such as access to settings, query execution and scripting. *Scoped permissions* determine access to observability data and some resource types like SUSE Observability Views.  For CRUD operations on SUSE Observability Views, these can be granted for a specific view or for all views. For details of the permissions attached to each predefined role in SUSE Observability, see xref:/setup/security/rbac/rbac_roles.adoc#_predefined_roles[predefined roles]

The following permissions are available in SUSE Observability:

^[1]^ This is a *scoped permission*, the interpretation of the resource name depends on the context

=== Scoped permissions

You can grant certain permissions system-wide, or you can limit them to a subset of the resources.  You can give them a *Resource Name*, which indicates the scope.  The interpretation of this name is dependent on the type of resource.  Note that the scoping may apply to only some of the verbs.

* `views` - The name of the view
* `topology` - Any component label. In a Kubernetes environment, this can be, for example, `cluster-name:<cluster-name>` or `k8s-scope:<cluster-name>/<namespace>`
* `metrics` - In a Kubernetes environment, either `k8s:<cluster-name>:\\__any__` or `k8s:<cluster-name>:<namespace>`
* `traces` - In a Kubernetes environment, either `k8s.cluster.name:<cluster-name>` or `k8s.scope:<cluster-name>/<namespace>`
* `scoped-permissions` - The name of the cluster for which permissions are managed
